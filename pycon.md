## Additional Notes
### On this project
This is a project I have already completed. I actively use it in my room (or I did in the summer anyway). Not only that, I've also already thought a lot about how to make it accessible to others, regardless of their experience level with hardware/Raspberry Pi. Here is a link to [my writeup](https://mlauter.github.io/how-to-make-your-own-smart-ac/) about it on my blog. I'm also working on a submission to [Instructables.com](http://www.instructables.com/)'s ['teach it'](http://www.instructables.com/contest/teachit/) contest, and I'll upload that link once it's on the site.

### On speaking experience

I've spent the past couple months at [Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com/), a 'writers retreat for programmers,' and I've given several lightening talks to the group of around 80 people (current students, facilitators, and alumni). I do not currently have a recording, but I will record the next talk I give and upload the video. I also presented a poster at the [2014 CUNY](https://cuny14.osu.edu/program) sentence processing conference.
